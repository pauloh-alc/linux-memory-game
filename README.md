## About the Memory Game

This is one of the most famous memory games and one of the most fun as well. In it, a certain number of cards are positioned so that the part with the design is facing downwards. 

In each turn the player must choose two cards and turn them over. If they form a pair, they are removed from the game. Otherwise, they are turned over again. This process must be repeated until all cards are removed.
